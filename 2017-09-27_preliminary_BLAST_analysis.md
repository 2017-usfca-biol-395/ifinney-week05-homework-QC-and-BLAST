# Thoughts and Preliminary Reasearch about BLAST Summary Results
 After taking the time to parse out and organize the data I received from my BLAST results into concise files, I began to open up each file and look at take a preliminary look at some of the sequence work. It was clear that the size of matches for each sequence correlated to how big the 
 file size was. I also immediately noticed that almost all of the sequence files shared had at 
 least two common genetic matches present within a particular organism. It almost seemed as if 
 the "top hits" (sequence matches) in some of the files were identical matches to some of the 
 other ones. After doing some initial online research on the highest sequence matches, I realized 
 that these sequences came from multiple different types of organisms. Some of the organisms that 
 these sequence samples were derived from are the hearts of human and dogs, beetles, and 
 microbial single cells. After doing this initial reasearch on each sequence file, my reasoning 
 about why certain files took longer than others BLASTing was further supported because of the 
 simple fact that the more complex and multicellular that an organism is, the longer its sequences are.

 After researching some of the most common sequence matches, I noticed that not only did 
 some of the files had exact matches, some of the different matches also shared very similar 
 traits. To me, the most inteesting set of sequences that shared some obvious commonalities are the 
 Bacteroidetes endosymbiont of Metaseiulus occidentalis and Solemya pervernicosa gill 
 symbiont. The Metaseiulus occidentalis is a type of mite. Mites are unique animals in their 
 phylum in that they can inhabit pretty much an type of environment, either terrestrial or 
 aquatic. Being arthopods means that they possess multiple genomes that include their own 
 and those of the symbionts that live within them. Similarly, the Solemya pervernicosa is a 
 type marine invertebrate that acts as a host to sulfur-oxiding chemoautotrophic bacteria. 
 These microbial endosymbiots living in these small organisms are usually dwell inside their 
 digestive or reproductive tracts. Symbionts provide esstential amino acids and act as an 
 aid in their reproduction. This means that the relationship between these two organisms is 
 imperative to their survival. The way in which these organisms symbionts are transferred 
 into their hosts can be accomplished in a few different ways. Symbionts can come into their 
 hosts externally through the process of infecting symbiont-free organisms in the 
 environment. They can also tranfer horizontally. This is done through symbiont-free 
 offspring becoming infected by their parent population. The last way to become infected is 
 through vertical transfer. Becoming infected vertically happens through symbionts being 
 transferred directly from mother to offspring. This method of transfer is beneficial to 
 symbionts because it increases their frequency for survival. They can work to amplify the 
 fitness or the reproductive process of their hosts so that their manipulation inherently 
 enhances their own transmission between host bodies. The disadvantage of this method is 
 that this tranfer leads to genetic loss and genome erosion over time. Examing varies 
 oranisms shows that uses different modes of transfer could help enhance the symbiont genome 
 evolution overall.

 After doing my research, the two most interesting sequence matches that I encountered are 
 the Bartonella washoensis and the Staphylococcus succinus. The Bartonella washoensis is a 
 baacterium that was first isolated from a mixed Doberman pinscher dog in 2001. The way in 
 which scientists were able to isolate this bacteria was through the use of serology and 
 PCR. This dog unfortunately had mitral valve endocarditis which directly affected the dog's 
 heart function and stability. After years of performing scientists discovered many 
 implications that this little bacterium can cause to its subjects. These bacterium are 
 transferred to mammals through arthopods or fleas and then they effectly act as parasites 
 that infects different cells in a mammal's body.They unfortunately effectly weaken the 
 organism by giving it symptoms that range from a high fever all the way to a life 
 threatening form of endocarditis. Over time, this bacterium has evolved into more species 
 variations that are now infecting a wider variety of hosts. On a more postive note, because 
 the entire genome of Bartonella has been sequenced, scientists can potentially use this 
 knowledge to create more effective drugs to counteract their deadly effects. Staphylococcus 
 succinus are coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) that are often found within human 
 microflora which means they mainly inhabit the skin, skin glands, and mucous membranes. 
 They can also be found in amber, and in the micorflora of fermented and fresh sausages. The 
 negative effects that this form of staphylococcus has on humans are that they also act as 
 pathogens. As the body recognizes this infection, the immune system releases chemicals to 
 fight it but in the process of this, the subject develops sepsis. In young subjects, such 
 as babies, sepsis often leads to the child becoming severely underweight and eventually 
 succumbing to death. Through the use of a genomic DNA kit, the genome of this staphylococcus 
 was obtained. Again, there are potentially many life-saving treatments that could be developed 
 for people who are infected.
